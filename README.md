## Technology Stack

The following technologies were used in this project, each serving a specific role in the system's architecture:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for rapid development of secure and scalable web applications. In this project, it is used to build RESTful APIs and manage server-side logic.

- **PostgreSQL**: An advanced open-source relational database system. It is used to store and manage structured data efficiently with support for complex queries.

- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It helps reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data, improving API performance and flexibility.

- **Docker**: A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.

- **Nginx**: A web server used to serve the application, handle static files, and act as a reverse proxy for load balancing and performance optimization.

- **Redis**: An in-memory data store used for caching and real-time data processing to improve the application‚Äôs speed and responsiveness.

- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool used to automate testing and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.
